# Hello, World! Iâ€™m Krishna!

Hey, Iâ€™m **Krishna**! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m currently a **Student Intern** at **Nokia**, where Iâ€™m diving into the world of software development and tech. When I'm not coding, Iâ€™m a part-time **tech explorer** and a **full-time Linux enthusiast**. Youâ€™ll often find me tinkering with my Linux system or running code through the terminal.

You can also checkout my linux page on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thelinuxworld)

But there's more to me than just tech! I'm also an **aspiring guitar hero** ðŸŽ¸ (though debugging code sometimes takes precedence). When I'm not working on tech projects, Iâ€™m jamming out to music, always searching for the next playlist to fuel my coding sessions or just to unwind.

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my **Master's in Computer Applications** at **Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)**. Itâ€™s been an exciting journey so far, and Iâ€™m constantly amazed by the possibilities that technology offers.

I created this blog as a space to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences as I explore the ever-evolving world of tech. 

Letâ€™s code, create, and maybe even rock out a little along the way! Stay tuned for more posts as I share my journey in tech, development, and maybe some music along the way.
